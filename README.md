# DQNAtari

This project implements deep q networks to solve atari games in openai gym.

Recommended to use GPU if possible else it is extremely slow.
To run program use the command: python Atari_dqn.py -e "environment_name"

Where 
  â‹… environment_name is the atari game to be solved. Eg "Breakout-v0" Full list of environments can be found at https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari. 
  Be sure to use non Ram versions as the program uses pixels as inputs instead.
  
  
The project was constructed with assistance of the book "Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-on"
